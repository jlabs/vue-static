# My blog, because reasons

Default layout and styling (ish) from the Gridsome framework. Initially created in React/Gatsby, this is a try at Vue with Gridsome for the same effect.
Blog posts typed in MD (markdown) which are easily transfered from framework to framework, luckily.

### Where?
The site is published at [on Netlify](https://jlabs.netlify.com) and 'hosted' here on Github. Netlify is clever in that when new changes are pushed to the Git repo, Netlify rebuilds the site and publishes to the URL auto-magically.
