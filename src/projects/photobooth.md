Got a big birthday coming up for someone, and they're after a photobooth I've used previously. That setup used an iPad, a Selphy printer, and props. I want to better that.

The idea is to, maybe, use Tracking.js to 'track' torches so that people can draw on themselves in an app running on a laptop (or Pi). The photo can then be printed (and stored for sharing later) for keepsakes.
