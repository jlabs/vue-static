# Hello
It's 00:30 according to the time in the top right of the screen and for some reason I'm typing this post.

This is the first manually typed post using Gatsby.

Wahoo!

For some reason I shall keep this page, and previous posts that were created for Jekyll (which was OK, but I much prefer Gatsby so far).

Time for bed. Will probably have to get up in 5 hours.
