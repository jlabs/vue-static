## Hey-lo WORLD!
So this is the first post live on the world wide something-ness.

The site is now powered by [link]GatsbyJS, because of reasons. At first I thought Jekyll would be the way forward, but after getting this site setup and running under Gatsby - I've chose to remian on this platform.

### Styling is a little bit logo'd up? What gives?
Good question no-one.
I have followed a very well set out bunch of tutorials over at [Level Up](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/pro-gatsby-2) so the site is a little theme'd to their colours and images, BUT! it will change.

### For now
This is probaly how the site will stay (I need sleep), but if you head over to a site called [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlabs_), you can see what's going on. I might even add a Twitter feed to the site so its a little more actual 'live' rather than static.

#### Latorz!
