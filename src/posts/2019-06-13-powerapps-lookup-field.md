Spent the last few days (weeks) trying to fathom how a lookup view (when using a lookup field) in PowerApps(Dynamics) would only show the icon of an entitiy, and not the custom fields I'd set in the lookup view.
Turns out (after reading the site https://community.dynamics.com/crm/f/117/t/270534) that the view shows the primary field.
Whats the primary field in a custom entity? In my case, its the "Name" field. It was mostly a guess as the name field shows up by deault, among other things, when creating a custom entity.
