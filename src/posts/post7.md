## Please wait
Just put together a quick 'coming soon' page for a little project I've been doing for someone.

Learning Gatsby is part of the project (for the future), but it'll just be a simple one page site for now.

## But where have you been?
Without getting into too much detail, I took some time off for reasons. Wasn't in the right headspace to do any of this, so didn't ... but I'm back (ish).

I really need to style this site. It look gash.
