Well it's been a fun couple of nights.

Components haven't changed much. The nav and footer are their own component, and I'm currently using Flexbox to get two columns of latest posts in the footer (3 breaks the flow).

As you can see, hopefully, I've added NES.CSS to the site to give a reto game feel (credits to come). For some reason, the initial build process Netlify carried out did something to the body font, so had to fix that by re-applying the font name (free on Google Fonts).

Still some bits to sort, but the main thing is that this site is now a copy of what I have locally ... and it's built with no errors (for some reason a local build would work, but not when pushed to Netlify - having layouts that aren't used by anything broke it).

More to come.
