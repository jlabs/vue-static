This is kind of an end post, kinda.

Having played with Gatsby, I thought I'd look at Gridsome which is built on Vue.js

I like it.

Getting the site up is fairly straight forward - there's plenty of docs (including the official), and using GitHub to host the source folder requires little know-how. I'd recomend looking at Netlify (where this site is actually viewable), which builds the site once pushed to GitHub. Some sort of wizardry going on there.

Might stick with Gridsome for now, and look into the plugins more.

Shall also be publishing little tinkerings on here when/if they get finished.

Laters.
